Before submitting a pull request, note that `master` and the respective
chapter branches need to stay in sync with the print version of the book.

- If your PR consists of clarifications, bug fixes, or other vital enhancements, please submit your PR against `master`.
- If your PR has performance improvements, simplifications, added functionality that would alter the main text of the book etc., please open your PR against the `improvements` branch.

Should your current PR mix these types of changes, please consider to split it accordingly. Thank you!
